Advantages of SPRING:
1.Loosely coupled.
2.Depends on simple jars and jdk .

Tightly Coupled : When one object creates another object inside its class any change in other object will not be possible from outside world
                  (i-e driver class).
Loosely Coupled : The dependency between modules must be via inyterfaces.
